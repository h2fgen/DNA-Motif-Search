# DNA-Motif-Search
Repeated-randomized motif search was applied to look for unique sequences among variants of Huntington's disease exon-1 genes. The search revealed a 108-nucleotide sequence highly conserved in humans, Rhesus monkeys, mice, and rat. The algorithm computed a motif score of 13 for the sequence and can be applied to any known genomic sequences.
